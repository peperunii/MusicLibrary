Variable names consist of a letter followed by any number of letters, digits or underscore.

MATLAB is case-sensitive.

OPERATORS-----------------
+	Addition or unary plus. A+B adds A and B. A and B must have the same size, unless one is a scalar. A scalar can be added to a matrix of any size.
-	Subtraction or unary minus. A-B subtracts B from A. A and B must have the same size, unless one is a scalar. A scalar can be subtracted from a matrix of any size.
*	Matrix multiplication. C = A*B is the linear algebraic product of the matrices A and B. More precisely,

Matrix Multiplication

For nonscalar A and B, the number of columns of A must equal the number of rows of B. A scalar can multiply a matrix of any size.
.*	Array multiplication. A.*B is the element-by-element product of the arrays A and B. A and B must have the same size, unless one of them is a scalar.
/	Slash or matrix right division. B/A is roughly the same as B*inv(A). More precisely, B/A = (A'\B')'.
./	Array right division. A./B is the matrix with elements A(i,j)/B(i,j). A and B must have the same size, unless one of them is a scalar.
\	Backslash or matrix left division. If A is a square matrix, A\B is roughly the same as inv(A)*B, except it is computed in a different way. If A is an n-by-n matrix and B is a column vector with n components, or a matrix with several such columns, then X = A\B is the solution to the equation AX = B. A warning message is displayed if A is badly scaled or nearly singular.
.\	Array left division. A.\B is the matrix with elements B(i,j)/A(i,j). A and B must have the same size, unless one of them is a scalar.
^	Matrix power. X^p is X to the power p, if p is a scalar. If p is an integer, the power is computed by repeated squaring. If the integer is negative, X is inverted first. For other values of p, the calculation involves eigenvalues and eigenvectors, such that if [V,D] = eig(X), then X^p = V*D.^p/V.
.^	Array power. A.^B is the matrix with elements A(i,j) to the B(i,j) power. A and B must have the same size, unless one of them is a scalar.
'	Matrix transpose. A' is the linear algebraic transpose of A. For complex matrices, this is the complex conjugate transpose.
.'	Array transpose. A.' is the array transpose of A. For complex matrices, this does not involve conjugation.
